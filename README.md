Inspired from: https://github.com/GiorgiGrigolia06/FlightSearch

Apart of Unit 6 of the Android Basics with Compose course, this flight search app is a project intended to allow users to query a departure airport and present a list of flights that depart from that airport. Furthermore, users are able to select flight preferences of their favorite routes.
